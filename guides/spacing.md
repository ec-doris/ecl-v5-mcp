# Spacing


Spacing are used to consistently apply margin and padding across elements,
components and layouts. With a set scale for spacing, information can be
structured to have a consistent and intuitive user interface across the
website.

## Use of space

A vertical rhythm starts from a baseline and it's the basis for everything from the font sizes, line height and image sizes. The spacing are always referring to fixed values and thus they are not responsive. All spacing can be used as values for both margins and paddings.

Space is used to create hierarchy and visual relationships. By using the spacing, you can achieve visual grouping and other associations both between and within the components. Along with the typography system, they contribute to an overall visual hierarchy, providing users with a structured way of organising information.
